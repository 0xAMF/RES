# OOP / object-oriented programming is a structured way of writing code based on classes and subclasses
# each class / subclass has attributes and methods (functions)
# In OOP there are some important definitions like:
# Inheritance: where a subclass inherits a parent class' attributes
# Abstraction: where a parent class can be accessible only through sub-classes
